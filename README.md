# ClimateViz Project

Welcome to the ClimateViz Project on GitHub! Our mission is to enhance understanding and address misinformation within Climate Science through the power of data visualization. By joining us, you're contributing to a vital effort in combating climate misinformation with accuracy and precision.

## Project Overview

The ClimateViz project focuses on developing an automated fact-checking system that leverages a comprehensive dataset of Climate Science Graphics. These graphics are rich with reliable information and are crucial in our fight against climate misinformation.

### Our Goal

Our primary goal is to create detailed, objective, and accurate descriptions for each graphic in our dataset. These descriptions are essential in developing an effective automated fact-checking system to identify and correct misconceptions in Climate Science.

## Contributing Guidelines

We're thrilled to have you contribute to this project! Here are a few guidelines to help you get started:

### Understanding the Task

- **Objective Descriptions**: We aim for impartiality in our descriptions. Focus solely on the visual content without inferring intentions or making subjective judgments.

- **Climate Science Knowledge**: A basic understanding of climate science is beneficial. It will aid in accurately interpreting and describing the graphics.

### How to Find Titles and Sources

- **Titles**: Often found at the top or bottom of the graphic, titles are crucial for context. They might also be indicated in accompanying text or the section title if the graphic is part of a larger document or presentation.

- **Sources**: Look for authors, credits, or entities associated with the graphic's creation. Source information is typically located below the graphic, within the image itself, or in the accompanying text. If multiple sources are mentioned, include all, and use "NA" if the source is uncertain or missing.

### Describing Climate Science Graphics

When describing graphics, focus on the following elements:

- **Axes Labels and Units**: Clearly identify what each axis represents, including any units of measurement.
- **Data Trends**: Describe significant trends shown in the graphic.
- **Colours and Symbols**: Explain the meaning of colours and symbols used.
- **Overall Message**: Summarise the main conclusion or message conveyed by the graphic.
- **Detail and Specificity**: Provide detailed descriptions to allow comprehension without seeing the graphic.
- **Complex Graphics**: Break down complex graphics into sections, covering each part before summarising the overall message.
