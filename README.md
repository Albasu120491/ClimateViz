Welcome to the ClimateViz project

Thank you for joining our effort! Together, we aim to enhance understanding and address misinformation in Climate Science.

We've amassed a comprehensive dataset of Climate Science Graphics, rich with reliable information. Our goal is to create an automated fact-checking system to tackle climate misinformationâ€”a challenging but crucial endeavour. To achieve this, we're gathering detailed, accurate manual descriptions of our dataset.

Understanding the Task

We need to collect detailed, objective descriptions for each graphic.

Thus, your descriptions should be impartial and based on the visual content of the graphic. Avoid inferring intentions, making assumptions, or including subjective judgments.

Before you begin, ensure you have a basic understanding of climate science concepts. This knowledge will help you accurately interpret the graphics.

Guidance on Finding the Title

Look at the Top: Titles are often located at the top of the graphic. They may be in a larger font size compared to other text elements to stand out.

Check the Bottom: If not found at the top, some graphics may have their titles at the bottom, especially if it is an infographic or a detailed diagram.

Examine the Surrounding Text: For graphics embedded in documents or web pages, the title might not be on the graphic itself but in the accompanying text immediately before or after the graphic.

Consider the Context: In cases where the graphic is part of a larger presentation or document, the title of the section it is in might serve as the title for the graphic, especially if individual graphics are not labelled. 

Guidance on Finding the Source

Authors and Credits: Begin by looking for any names or entities credited with creating the graphic. This could be in the form of "Created by [Name]" or "[Name] (Year)". When a graphic lists authors or creators, such as "Shwed and Bearman (2010)," please include this information exactly as it appears.

Combining Information: If the graphic includes both author names and credit to an organisation or publication, separate these pieces of information with a comma. For example, "Shwed and Bearman (2010), National Geographic".

Location of Source Information: Source information can typically be found in the following places:

Below the Graphic: Often, the source is cited directly below the image.
On the Graphic:  Some graphics may include the source or authorship within the image itself, particularly in the corner or along the edges.
Accompanying Text: For graphics embedded in documents or webpages, source information might be in the accompanying text or caption, rather than on the graphic.


Use Caution with Multiple Sources: If a graphic mentions multiple sources or contributions (e.g., data from one source, graphic created by another), include all mentioned parties, separating each with a comma.

If Unsure, Use "NA": Accuracy is crucial. If you cannot confidently identify the source information or if it appears to be missing, please use "NA". This helps maintain the integrity of our data collection process.

Describing Key Features and Data Presentation of Climate Science Graphics

Your task is to objectively describe the important elements within each graphic. Your descriptions should be clear, concise, and in English. Focus on accurately conveying the graphic's content, which will require detailing the **axes labels, data trends, use of colours and symbols**, and **summarising the overall message** of the graphic.

Axes Labels and Units: 
Clearly identify what each axis represents, including any units of measurement. For example, "The X-axis represents years from 2000 to 2020, and the Y-axis measures temperature in degrees Celsius."
Data Trends:

Describe significant trends shown in the graphic. 
For example, "A bar graph illustrates a steady increase in global carbon emissions over the past two decades."

Colours and Symbols:
Explain the meaning of colours and symbols used in the graphic. For instance, "Red circles represent high-emission countries, while blue circles represent low-emission countries."

Overall Message:
Summarise the main conclusion or message conveyed by the graphic. This might be, "A line graph displays rising ocean temperatures over 20 years, highlighting a trend towards global warming."

Detail and Specificity:
Provide enough detail to **allow someone who cannot see the graphic to understand its key points**. This includes mentioning any notable annotations, legends, or keys that are part of the graphic.

Summarising Complex Graphics:
For more complex graphics, break down your description into sections, covering each component part before summarising the overall message.

Examples for Better Clarity:
Correct: "The graphic uses a green line to show the increase in renewable energy production from 2000 to 2020, with annotations highlighting significant policy introductions."
Avoid: "The graphic shows that renewable energy is becoming more popular because of policies."
Example: There is a consistent upward trajectory of all datasets post-1970s.
